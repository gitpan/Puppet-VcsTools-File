v1.004 2007-09-18 Dominique Dumont
       * Dummy revision. Somehow v1.003 was removed from CPAN, so I've created
         this new version to provide this module again. No other change 
         was made.

v1.003 1999-10-11  Dominique Dumont  <domi@barrayar.grenoble.hp.com>

	* lib/Puppet/VcsTools/File.pm: 
	- modified call to History, HmsAgent constructor to use the new
	translucent attributes 
	- All xxxArgs are deprecated.

v1.002 1999-08-20  Dominique Dumont  <domi@barrayar.grenoble.hp.com>

	* lib/Puppet/VcsTools/File.pm (new): 
	- adapted for File/Source split on VcsTools::File.
