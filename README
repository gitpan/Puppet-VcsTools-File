The Puppet-VcsTools-File package provides a GUI interface to the 
VcsTools-File package. With both these packages you will be able to 
manage HMS or RCS file with a graphical user interface and perform the
following function:

- check-in, check-out of files
- lock and unlock
- display a graph showing the revision tree (with bindings 
  to easily get diff between revision or the log of each revision)
- edit the history information through a dedicated window and archive it 
  in the Vcs system.
- help to merge revision by checking out the different revision and 
  connect you to xemacs ediff session to let you perform the merge.
- keep a cache in a MLDBM file so that a history retrieve is not necessary
  each time you start the tool.

Note that only HP HMS and RCS are currently implemented. HMS is part
of the HP Softbench CM product.  If this address is reachable, you can
get more info on http://www.hp.com/esy/go/softbench.html

  
This module also contains an executable perl program named hmsWork. This
exec file is the user callable program to actually monitor the HMS file.

I've also provided a rcsWork program to manage RCS files.


I'd like people who actually use this module for their application to
drop me a short note about what they're using this module for. 


This module was written with perl5.005 and Tk800.015. 

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Note that this module is in beta state. Its interface may change (but
I hope not).
